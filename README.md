# HOME-PRICE-PREDICTION-MASTER-IN-MACHINE-LEARNING
## Introduction
House Price predictions are very stressful work as we have to consider different things while buying a house like the structure and the rooms kitchen parking space and gardens. People don’t know about the factors that influence the house price. But by using Machine learning we can easily find the house which is to be perfect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.
## Description: 
Predict home prices using XGBoost with factors like income, schools, hospitals, and crime rates.
## Importing Libraries and Dataset
Here we are using 

### Pandas 
* To load the Dataframe
### Matplotlib 
* To visualize the data features i.e. barplot
### Seaborn 
* To see the correlation between features using the heatmap
## Data cleaning:
Data cleaning is the way to improvise the data or remove incorrect, corrupted or irrelevant data.

As in our dataset, there are some columns that are not important and irrelevant for the model training. So, we can drop that column before training. There are 2 approaches to dealing with empty/null values

* We can easily delete the column/row (if the feature or record is not much important).
* Filling the empty slots with mean/mode/0/NA/etc. (depending on the dataset requirement).
## Model and Accuracy:
As we have to train the model to determine the continuous values, so we will be using these regression models.

* PCA
* Linear Regressor
### Linear Regression Machine Learning
In the ever-evolving world of technology, machine learning has become a powerful tool to tackle various real-world challenges. One such application is predicting house prices using linear regression for real estate. The ability to forecast property values can immensely benefit real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers alike. In this blog, we will explore a fascinating machine learning project that leverages the linear regression algorithm to predict house sale prices accurately using python.
### Understanding Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In the context of house price prediction, the dependent variable will be the house price, and the independent variables can be factors like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

### House Price Prediction with Linear Regression Involves Following Steps:

* Dataset Collection: Gather historical house price data and corresponding features from platforms like Zillow or Kaggle.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering, such as converting categorical variables to numerical representations.
* Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.
* Building the Model: Create a linear regression model to learn the relationships between features and house prices.
* Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance on the testing set using metrics like MSE or RMSE.
* Fine-tuning the Model: Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve the model’s accuracy.
* Deployment and Prediction: Deploy the robust model into a real-world application for predicting house prices based on user inputs.

### Understanding Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. It's a powerful technique used in various fields, especially data science and machine learning, for dimensionality reduction. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

#### Why use it?

Reduce complexity: Working with high-dimensional data can be computationally expensive and difficult to visualize. PCA makes it easier to handle and analyze data by reducing its size.
Identify patterns: PCA helps identify the most significant underlying patterns in the data. These patterns often represent the most important information in the data.
Improve performance: By reducing dimensionality, PCA can sometimes improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
#### How does it work?
* Centering and normalization: PCA often involves centering the data (subtracting the mean from each feature) and normalizing it (scaling each feature to have unit variance). This ensures all features are on the same scale and contributes to the analysis.
* Finding principal components: PCA then creates new features, called principal components, that are linear combinations of the original features. 
### Applications of PCA:
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing data using PCA plots can help identify clusters, outliers, and relationships between variables.
* Image compression: By applying PCA to image data, you can compress images while retaining the essential information.
* Anomaly detection: PCA can be used to identify data points that deviate significantly from the main patterns, potentially indicating anomalies.
### House Price Prediction with pca involves Following Steps:
1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning:

* Gather a dataset containing various features related to houses, such as size, location, amenities, etc.
* Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Feature Engineering (Optional):

This step involves creating new features from existing ones or transforming existing features to potentially improve model performance. It's not mandatory, but can be beneficial.
3. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction:

Perform PCA on the features to:
* Reduce the number of features while capturing the most important information.
* Potentially address issues like multicollinearity, which can negatively impact model performance.
* Choose the number of principal components to retain based on the desired balance between information retention and dimensionality reduction.
4. Splitting Data:

* Divide your data into two sets:
* Training set: Used to train the machine learning model.
* Test set: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
5. Model Selection and Training:

* Choose a suitable machine learning model for house price prediction, such as linear regression, random forest, or support vector machines.
* Train the model on the training data, using the principal components as features and the actual house prices as the target variable.
6. Model Evaluation:

* Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test data using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

* This step involves adjusting the model's hyperparameters (settings) to improve its performance.
* You can use techniques like grid search or randomized search to find the best hyperparameter values.
8. Prediction:

* Once you have a well-performing model, you can use it to predict house prices for new data points based on their features.
Key Points:

* PCA is not mandatory for house price prediction but can be beneficial in certain situations.
* The number of principal components to retain should be chosen carefully to balance information retention and model performance.
* This is a simplified overview, and the specific steps may vary depending on the chosen model and desired level of complexity.
## Conclusion:
While utilizing both linear regression and PCA can be a viable approach for house price prediction, its effectiveness depends heavily on the specific dataset and chosen parameters. PCA's dimensionality reduction can improve interpretability and potentially address multicollinearity, but might lead to information loss. Evaluating the model's performance through metrics like R-squared and comparing it to alternatives like without PCA can help determine the best approach for your specific situation.
